* Game - by Pluizer

* Key points
  * Turn based
  * Every character is fully simulated
  * Rather a small but full world than a vast empty one
  * No skills, instead of leveling up you make your enemy weaker
  * Rogue-like but not randomly generated

* Technical
  * Made in Chicken Scheme and my Coati-2D
  * Fully 2D, isometric tiles
